/**
 * On both Android and Windows, while both mouse and touch are supported input devices,
 * only one of them can be active at a time. Touch the screen with a finger will deactivate mouse,
 * and move the mouse will deactivate touch.
 *
 * On Android, this is achieved by dispatching a `MotionEvent.ACTION_UP` event for the previous input type.
 * But on Chrome, there is no such event, causing both mouse and touch to be active at the same time.
 * This can cause the new input to appear as "ignored".
 *
 * This helper class synthesis `ACTION_UP` events when a different pointer type appears,
 * so Scrcpy server can remove the previously hovering pointer.
