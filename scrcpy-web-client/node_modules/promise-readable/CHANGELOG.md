## v1.2.0 2017-10-03

* `once` is resolved to `undefined` when stream is already closed or
  destroyed for `"close"` or `"end"` events and rejects for others.
* `read` and `readAll` is resolved when `"close"` event was occured.

## v1.1.0 2017-10-01

* Typescript: stream is `TReadable extends NodeJS.ReadableStream`

## v1.0.0 2017-09-28

* Exports also as a class and namespace and the default.
* Typings for Typescript.
* Additional safe checks for detecting already closed stream.

_Breaking change:_

* Resolves to `undefined` rather than `null` if there is no data or stream is
    closed. Please use double sign equality instead triple sign to check if
    stream is closed, ie. `data == null`.
